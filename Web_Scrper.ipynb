      "Over the Horizon 2022 produced by Suga of BTS. The song of the same title plays. Then, each of the members of the K-pop band, BTS, is seen in a series of slow-moving close up portrait clips. Then, at a faster pace, one band member extends his arm toward the spinning camera to show a colorized, folded Galaxy Z Flip4 in Bora Purple. Now, band members are dancing to the music with the device in their hands. They pose for a series of quick snapshots. They gleefully dance with Galaxy Z Flip4 in hand. Then, two members sit on a couch together, one holding the unfolded phone horizontally. They are watching a video on the Main Screen. The other member snatches the phone from him. The one originally holding the phone picks up another from the seat of the couch to use it instead. The member sitting next to him snatches the second device as well. Members continue to pose like they were taking photos. Another reaches toward the camera as if it were the Galaxy Z Flip4. Then, the video frame instantly transforms into the Main Screen of a Galaxy Z Flip4 as two band members grab it and turn the screen toward themselves to look at it. They appear surprised. Like before, a member reaches out toward the camera. The video frame becomes yet another Main Screen of a Galaxy Z Flip4. Here, three members inspect the device with curiosity. Again, someone reaches toward the camera and it turns into another Main Screen that is being grabbed by yet another member. Now, the whole band is present in the scene, each holding a Galaxy Z Fold4 in Bora Purple. They all come to look at what is on the screen of the last person to pick up the phone. Next, one band member playfully snatches the device from the hands of another and runs away as the other pretends to still be holding the device and touching the screen with his thumbs. Next, another band member comes into the frame dancing with the Galaxy Z Flip4 in Flex mode. There are a series of short portrait clips of each member dancing with the phone. Gradually, the clips begin to show full-body portraits and they dance around a large purple frame in the shape of a cube. Last, they are all gathered together for a group photo. The photo ratio is a square. The square continues to recede backward, and then vanishes as if it were a shutter being closed into a horizontal line. Samsung Galaxy logo and BTS logo.\n",
